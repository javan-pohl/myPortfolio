Full-stack developer proficient in Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL.

I'm a **passionate problem solver** with a near **obsessive focus on the customer**. My philosophy is that **apps should be 1) fast, 2) easy-to-use, and 3) aesthetically pleasing**. 

## BIO

I'm new to the world of professional software development, but I have utilized technology to solve problems for much of my adult life and professional career. During college at **Colorado State University - Pueblo**, I **minored in Computer Information Systems** while I was pursuing my **Bachelor's in Accounting**. As an **auditor with the Federal Government**, I was my region's **Excel/VBA expert**. During my time there, I tackled the challenge of combing through two separate **databases and creating the SQL queries** (in Access) needed to identify hospitals that qualified for outlier reconciliation. Prior to my work on that project, the hospitals themselves were responsible for determining whether or not they qualified for outlier reconciliation. 

My first real experience with coding came about 7 years ago as I was developing a passion project to **automate (with robotics and software)** the process of backing-up Blu-ray discs to a server--**a process I programmed in Perl** and still utilize to this day. **Building PCs** for that project gave me the idea to start my cell phone repair company FixNcell. One of the roles I was most passionate about was **fine-tuning my business website and Google Adwords campaign to maximize my conversation rates, website speed, and UX experience (particularly on mobile devices)**. 

After much deliberation, **in 2020 I decided to put myself on a path to the software development industry**. Initially, I was teaching myself JavaScript but opted to do a **software bootcamp with Hack Reactor** to accelerate the process. The intense program at Hack Reactor (which took up sometimes 80 hours a week in total) **vastly improved my skills with JavaScript and React**. Post-bootcamp, I am now working on **solidifying my testing and integration skills**, while continuing to work on **solid coding principles** (I'm basically listening to *The Pragmatic Programmer* audiobook on repeat until I memorize it). 

I am open to many paths in software development, but **my main desire is to develop high-quality mobile applications**, or at least applications that optimize for the mobile experience (not just desktop). I want to fine-tune my development skills so that I can **one day lead teams or companies to delivery high-quality products to the customer**.

## Ok, but *who am I*?

In my day-to-day life you can usually find me: exercising; watching movies/anime; trying to make healthy food interesting; dressing up in a costume for some silly, themed event; or working on some fun project at home. I'm continuously working on self-improvement and love helping others do the same. 

If you really want to bring out my chatty side, start talking to me about movies, particularly ones with some profound message about life (one of these days I'm going to put together a video talk on what everybody is missing about *Starship Troopers*--even the ones that *think* they "get it".) 

Speaking of movies, my primary goal in life is to construct the perfect home theater. Although my passion for that is somewhat waning in recent years as the movie studios (I'm looking at you, Disney) seem to be intent on (de)optimizing the at-home movie experience for lower-quality streaming.

I also have a terrible habit of making incredibly bad puns. Particularly in extremely vague fashion so as to test the pun-detection skills of those around me. 

## Software Philosophy

Focuses on **intuitive UX design** and configuring the stack design for **low latency.** Prefers to acquire a **deep understanding of concepts** in order to master the technology. **Facilitates clear communication** between teams and in documentation by **clarifying ambiguities in language**.

**Automate** *everything*.

Continuous improvement. **Never stop learning**.

## Software Skills

Strongly skilled in React, CSS, Nodes.js, Express, git, and SQL. Also experienced with: Redux, Mongodb, PostgreSQL, RESTful APIs, mySQL, Docker, Mocha. Lately I have been working on learning vim, regex, and Jest.
