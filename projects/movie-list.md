An app built using React and React-Router for page navigation and Material UI and custom CSS for formatting. Uses Oauth 2.0 at the onset to create a user off of your Google profile information. You can then search for movies and TV shows and allows you to save those movies to your list. The movie/tv queries are sent to and received from The Movie Database's API, while 'your list' is sent to the app's API (Express) in our postgreSQL database. Deployed on Heroku.
