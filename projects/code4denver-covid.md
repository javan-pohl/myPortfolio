### BarChart Mobile Optimization Updates  (4/12/21)

**I refactored the CSS code to make the charts more accessible on mobile devices.** As it was, the bar charts had the following issues on smaller screens:

1. The **bars would become transparent** (the cause of which, I discovered, was that the 1px white border around each bar element was overlapping the primary colors of the neighboring bar elements. Trickier still was what CSS property I needed to change to get rid of this border. Turns out that on SVG shapes, the border is listed as **'stroke'**.)
2. The **x-axis labels were overlapping** and becoming unreadable. (This I fixed by changing the format of the dates from July 1, 2021 to 7/1 and slightly reducing the font size.)
3. General **CSS spacing issues** (margin, padding, width, etc) resulted in excessive spacing that was not ideal for mobile viewing. (I fixed these issues by adding several **CSS Media Breakpoints**, CSS formatting that will only apply to display resolutions under or over a particular width. The main fix involved increasing the width of the graph cards to take up approximately 95% of the screen width.)
